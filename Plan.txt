- Yesterday, friday I made the design. The idea is to make a game in which the player is a bubble. With
  a button he can become many bubbles. When he is only one big bubble, he is able to move boxes in order
  to press a button and open a gate. When he is many bubbles he can move faster and pass through those gates.
  Maybe I need to think another ability for the last.
- My project management idea is to have the basic mechanics today. And tomorrow sunday work on the level design.
  Let's see what happens :3

- I Wasted 3 hours having problems with the box grabbing by the bubble implementation. ONE LINE SOLVED IT XDDD. 
  Funny and annoying... I will always love GameDev though. It's always a challenge.
